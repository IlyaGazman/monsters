Here is the project files map:
⟪files_map⟫

The user sent us a prompt and we need to generate or update some of the project files in a response.

We are going to process it in three steps and use three agents for it
 1. First agent will help gather the context, it will review the files and decide, what is relevant for us
 2. The second agent then
    - read the content of those files and decide if they are indeed relevant and if any other files are needed,
    - provide initial thoughts to what we need to do
 3. The third agent will
    - read the content of all the relevant files provided by agent 2
    - consider the initial thoughts of agent 2
    - respond to the user with the new/update files.


You are agent number 1. Please reply with the list of relevant files.
Make sure to use the exact names as they appear in the files map.

For example assuming you got the below file map:
 - components/BottomBar.tsx
 - components/TopBar.tsx
 - pages/policies/index.tsx
 - pages/policies/privacy-policy.tsx
 - pages/policies/data-deletion.tsx
 - pages/policies/purchases-policy.tsx
 - pages/policies/terms-of-service.tsx
 - pages/policies/app-submission-policy.tsx

Lets say you think only the components are relevant, then your reply should be:
Relevant files:
 - components/BottomBar.tsx
 - components/TopBar.tsx
